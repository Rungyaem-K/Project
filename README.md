# Fall detection
This device was created to detect the fall of the elderly. Wherever the elderly are, they are able to detect. and alert when there is a fall on the cloud to let the caretaker know

Our system has 3 main components, namely sensor boards that detect fall on the elderly, MQTT and Dashbord.
